Today, I've read [Mayank's Mastodon posts](https://front-end.social/@mayank/112643881288298292) about how git knowledge as a tool is often used ‚Äî more or less subtly, **as a way to exclude people** from considering themselves good as developer (whatever that means).

**And I completely relate and agree with that.**

To directly quote them:

<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote cite="https://front-end.social/@mayank/112643881288298292">
    <p><strong>You don't need to know Git to be a good developer</strong><br>
    <p aria-hidden="true"><i>[‚Ä¶]</i></p>
    Is Git still useful to know? sure.</p>
    <p>but knowing Git inside out is not a requirement for you being a good developer. it's just a tool for managing code.</p>

I relate because yeah, from my experience of my many years finding my way in diverse tech communities, it's full of ~~dudes~~ people spending a lot of energy finding ways to gatekeep their ‚Äúprecious‚Äù knowledge (üôÑ) like newcomers were going to remove something from their own identity. &ast;*sigh*&ast;

I felt the need to share their words in case it could help them enter some minds. But also to add my own experience to it.

## Command line is not required

I often saw and experienced myself, Git is being introduced through its Command Line Interface, aka writing commands in a terminal.

And as I can humbly affirm that I‚Äôm ‚Äúpretty good with git‚Äù. I understand how it works, how to do diverse tasks to achieve collaboration between people in plenty of different configurations.

I *however*, never really spent time learning the git CLI. I always work with a graphical client and **get shit done**.

For those few exceptions where I have to use CLI (like with servers), it‚Äôs easy to search and find the commands when you know the actions you wanna do.

Also, as an additional opinionated point: the git CLI in prticular is shit, has a terrible developer experience.

So yeah, my advice would be to learn how Git works if you need to work with it. Its logic, what problem you face it can solves and the grammar around those solutions.\
But don‚Äôt listen to gatekeepers deepshits, fuck them! üñï (Well actually no, don‚Äôt fuck them, no sex for gatekeeping techbros)

## The graphical interface option

1. I personally use [Fork](https://fork.dev) as graphical client (available for macOS and Windows), as it has always delivered a great experience for the past ~5years.
2. I know coworkers from my previous job (on Windows and Linux) who were using [Git Kraken](https://www.GitKraken.com) too.
3. Some code editors, like VSCode to mention the most used, have extensions or a native integration in their interface that will do the job for 95% of your use cases.
4. If you‚Äôre on Linux, [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/search?q=Git) may be somewhere to start searching.

But there are be plenty of others!

## As a conclusion

Tools are just tools: a way to get shit done. Obviously, there are materialistic parameters in our societies and industries that come into play. But things like tools, languages, frameworks and best practices comes and go. As long as achieve what you want (or have to to survive), ignore the noisy opiniatred dudes. This is a lost of time, and they're even often wrong.

**Screw the command line ‚Äúreligion‚Äù and the technocratic mindset that comes with it**.
