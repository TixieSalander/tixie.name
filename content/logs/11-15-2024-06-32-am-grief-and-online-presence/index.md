Little personal online advice from my personal experience (I’m not super good with words so I’ll keep it short).

I know you mean no harm but please, to someone opening themselves online about the struggling of dealing with some recent griefs and the cruelty of their world:

**Don’t send *unsolicited* suggestions on what they should do to go through this** (like starting yoga, meditation or some spiritual journey for example). 

Even if it feels relevant to you at the time. This is not the best time for that I assure you. 

Please, keep in mind that everyone grieve their own way. Think twice before pressing the “send” button in those situations 🩷
