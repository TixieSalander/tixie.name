It's the end of a chapter, after 7 years working as lead frontend dev and accessibility advocate in a wonderful web engineering agency, since the beginning of December I leaved my post (in good terms) to focus entirely on recovering from a long-ass never-ending burnout I was dealing for the past 2 or 3 years.

And then, I don't know maybe, find a way to create stuff I'm in love with again, in a more independent way?

Big step to the unknown, but fuck it we only have one life.

Feel free to follow and support me into this new part of my journey, as this chapter have a name: **[Guérilla.Studio](https://guerilla.studio)**, a small collective with the goal to improve the web one radical step at a time.
