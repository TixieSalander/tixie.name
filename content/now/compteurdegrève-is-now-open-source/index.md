I finally took the time to make a static postmortem version of [http://CompteurDeGreve.fr](http://CompteurDeGreve.fr "http\://compteurdegreve.fr/") and publish the website's source code. It's now available at [https://github.com/GuerillaHQ/compteur-de-greve](https://github.com/GuerillaHQ/compteur-de-greve "https\://github.com/GuerillaHQ/compteur-de-greve")

This project had as goal to offer an independent platform to count the participation during the French strike of March 7th of 2023, against Macron's pension reform(/destruction).\
\
I worked on the website design during a weekend and coded it (using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) for progressive enhancement) with the help of Milia during a sleepless night of early March.

Thank you again Salomé (who worked on the counter API) and Caroline De Haas (who initiated the project) for this collaboration with you ❤️ It was a intense but great experience!
