Hey there,\
Long time no see, I was busy dealing with a burn out and preparing an upcoming surgery at the same time, funny moments lmao ðŸ™ƒ.

You're reading this post so yeah, the surgery went pretty well, I'm good now.\
I even had the luxury to going out from hospitalization and discovering the city under the snow (wellâ€¦ while trying to walk correctly).

After the hard part of recovery, to avoid boredom I decided, since the site was down anyway, to recode [Vanilla List](https://vanillalist.top/), but this time on a stack I could manage (bye rails & postgre).

Goals: fast & light, static generated, and without the Hugo pain-in-the-ass templating language.

I tried [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev): it was simple, easy to setup, fast and I was free on templating. This last point was really great, I had a lot of fun playing with Nunjucks and JavaScript Template literals.

Actually it took me some time to make something functional while being high on meds half of the time and with a concentration time of max 30s ðŸ˜… but hey it's working for now.

At the end I took the opportunity to redesign+rewrite the frontend part and tried my best to optimize it.

ðŸ‘‰ Enjoy the new [Vanilla List](https://vanillalist.top/)!

That's it for the news. 2020 was a rough year for me and I don't expect 2021 to be better. \
But I'm not alone at Glitch.Family (my "two-women-one-cat-and-some-friends little studio" as I like to call it) and we're hoping to push some ideas on [Souvenir](https://souvenir.cam/) in the future:

* Gif History: Consult and re-dl your precedents gifs
* WebShare API: Share your souvenir more easily to contacts or to other apps on your phone
* Vue3 & Parcel2 upgrade

For now the RSS reader project is on pause. Milia made a working prototype but I currently don't have the time to really work on the design.

Soooo i guess see you next time ðŸ‘‹ â€¦ or on [Github](https://github.com/GlitchFamily)â€¦ or on the new [Glitch.Family Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GlitchFamilyHQ) (yeah we're on this hellsite) ðŸ‘€
