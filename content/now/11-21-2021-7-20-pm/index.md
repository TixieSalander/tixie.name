Who guess? Life isn't getting better.

Waking up every day in a country falling into authoritarianism and fascism at a frightening speed. Having to buy some of my everyday meds with crypto on the blackmarket just be able to live because it’s not commercialized anymore. My exhaustion keep increasing at the same speed that any interests feels more and more unappealing.

I don't know what the future will be, but duuh nothing seems great.

Anyway… I worked on Souvenir v2 design and code maintenance for a few days. Since the new features imply a deep refactoring on how encoding is made, and I don't know how to deal with that so don't expect anything soon.

Anyway, all I can share is a few photos from Netherlands, where I probably spent some of the happiest days of this year.
