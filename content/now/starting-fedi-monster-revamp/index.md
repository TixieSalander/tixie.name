I recently started working on a branding and web design revamp for our friends at [Fedi.Monster](https://Fedi.Monster "https\://fedi.monster/")

For now I'll just share a peak at the new logo and their cute mascot. 

{{< image src="showcase-visual-logo-2x.png" alt="A little green blob monster with one eyes, two tiny horns and a mouth with big teeth who makes the letter M in negative space. And next to it the name in big white letter and 'Seize the means of posting' bellow as a purple subtext">}}

For the rest, stay tune, it's gonna be out whenâ€¦ well when ready, considering I'm doing it on the side and my energy level is still as low as possible.
