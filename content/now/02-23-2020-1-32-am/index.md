Hey, I have some news since we worked on Eldritch Radio this weekend with Milia.

Queue list is now integrated:

We added a sharing feature, which allows you to send a link to the radio by starting it with a song of your choice. A great way to share the radio to your friends!

In the same vibe than the queue current track icon, i had great time animating the checkbox icon:

Then today I added the "small" player version, by modifying the CSS grid:
